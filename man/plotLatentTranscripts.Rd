\usage{
plotLatentTranscripts(gene, gown, method = c("hclust", "kmeans"), k = NULL,
  choosek = c("var90", "thumb"), returncluster = TRUE,
  labelTranscripts = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{string, name of gene whose transcripts should be clustered
(e.g., "XLOC_000001")}

\item{gown}{object of class \code{ballgown} being used for analysis}

\item{method}{clustering method to use.  Currently can choose from
hierarchical clustering (\code{hclust}) or K-means (\code{kmeans}).  More
methods are in development.}

\item{k}{number of transcripts clusters to use.  By default, \code{k} is
\code{NULL} and thus is chosen using a rule of thumb, but providing
\code{k} overrides those rules of thumb.}

\item{choosek}{if \code{k} is not provided, how should the number of clusters
be chosen?  Must be one of "var90" (choose a \code{k} that explains 90
percent of the observed variation) or "thumb" (\code{k} is set to be
approximately \code{sqrt(n)}, where n is the total number of transcripts
for \code{gene})}

\item{returncluster}{if TRUE (as it is by default), return the results of the
call to \code{clusterTrancsripts} so the data is available for later use.
Nothing is returned if FALSE.}

\item{labelTranscripts}{if TRUE (as it is by default), print transcript IDs
on the y-axis}

\item{...}{other arguments to pass to plotTranscripts}
}
\value{
if \code{returncluster} is TRUE, the transcript clusters are returned
  as described in \code{\link{clusterTranscripts}}. A plot of the transcript
  clusters is also produced, in the style of \code{\link{plotTranscripts}}.
}
\description{
This is an experimental, first-pass function that clusters assembled
transcripts based on their overlap percentage, then plots and colors the
transcript clusters.
