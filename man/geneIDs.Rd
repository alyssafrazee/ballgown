\usage{
geneIDs(x)

\S4method{geneIDs}{ballgown}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a ballgown object}
}
\value{
named vector of gene IDs included in the ballgown object. If object
was created using Tablemaker, these gene IDs will be of the form "XLOC_*".
Vector is named and ordered by corresponding numeric transcript ID.

\details{
This vector differs from that produced by geneNames in that geneIDs produces
names of loci created during the assembly process, not necessarily
annotated genes.
