\title{calculate percent overlap between two GRanges objects}
\usage{
pctOverlap(tx1, tx2)
}
\arguments{
\item{tx1}{GRanges object}

\item{tx2}{GRanges object}
}
\value{
percent overlap between \code{tx1} and \code{tx2}, as defined by the
  ratio of the intersection of \code{tx1} and \code{tx2} to the union of
  \code{tx1} and \code{tx2}.
}
\description{
calculate percent overlap between two GRanges objects
}
\details{
In the ballgown context, \code{tx1} and \code{tx2} are two
  transcripts, each represented by GRanges objects whose ranges represent the
  exons comprising the transcripts.  The percent overlap is the number of
  nucleotides falling within both transcripts divided by the number of
  nucleotides falling within either transcript.  Useful as a measure of
  transcript closeness (as it is essentially Jaccard distance).

\examples{
data(bg)
gtfPath = system.file('extdata', 'annot.gtf.gz', package='ballgown')
annot_grl = gffReadGR(gtfPath, splitByTranscript=TRUE)
pctOverlap(structure(bg)$trans[[2]], annot_grl[[369]]) #79.9\%
