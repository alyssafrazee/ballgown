\title{visualize transcript abundance by group}
\usage{
plotMeans(gene, gown, overall = FALSE, groupvar, groupname = "all",
  meas = c("cov", "FPKM", "rcount", "ucount", "mrcount", "mcov"),
  colorby = c("transcript", "exon"), legend = TRUE,
  labelTranscripts = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{name of gene whose transcripts will be plotted.  When using 
Cufflinks/Tablemaker output, usually of the form \code{"XLOC_######"}}

\item{gown}{ballgown object containing experimental and phenotype data}

\item{overall}{if \code{TRUE}, color features by the overall 
(experiment-wide) mean rather than a group-specific mean}

\item{groupvar}{string representing the name of the variable denoting which 
sample belongs to which group.  Can be \code{"none"} (if you want the 
study-wide mean), or must correspond to the name of a column of 
\code{pData(gown)}.  Usually a categorical variable.}

\item{groupname}{string representing which group's expression means you want 
to plot.  Can be \code{"none"} (if you want the study-wide mean), 
\code{"all"} (if you want a multipanel plot of each group's mean 
expression), or any of the levels of \code{groupvar}.}

\item{meas}{type of expression measurement to plot. One of "cov", "FPKM", 
"rcount", "ucount", "mrcount", or "mcov". Not all types are valid for all 
features. (See description of tablemaker output for more information).}

\item{colorby}{one of \code{"transcript"} or \code{"exon"}, indicating which 
feature's abundances should dictate plot coloring.}

\item{legend}{if \code{TRUE} (as it is by default), a color legend is drawn 
on top of the plot indicating the scale for feature abundances.}

\item{labelTranscripts}{if \code{TRUE}, transcript ids are labeled on the 
left side of the plot. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
produces a plot of the transcript structure for the specified gene in
  the current graphics device, colored by study-wide or group-specific mean 
  expression level.
