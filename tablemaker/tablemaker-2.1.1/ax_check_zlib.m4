#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_ZLIB()
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro searches for an installed zlib library. If nothing was
#   specified when calling configure, it searches first in /usr/local and
#   then in /usr. If the --with-zlib=DIR is specified, it will try to find
#   it in DIR/include/zlib.h and DIR/lib/libz.a. If --without-zlib is
#   specified, the library is not searched at all.
#
#   If either the header file (zlib.h) or the library (libz) is not found,
#   the configuration exits on error, asking for a valid zlib installation
#   directory or --without-zlib.
#
#   The macro defines the symbol HAVE_LIBZ if the library is found. You
#   should use autoheader to include a definition for this symbol in a
#   config.h file. Sample usage in a C/C++ source is as follows:
#
#     #ifdef HAVE_LIBZ
#     #include <zlib.h>
#     #endif /* HAVE_LIBZ */
