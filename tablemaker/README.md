## Tablemaker

Download the Tablemaker software for pre-processing Ballgown data here. Instructions for using the software are in the README of the [main Ballgown repository](https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown). 

You can build tablemaker from source by following [these instructions](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/tutorial.html). (The process is the same as building Cufflinks from source). Source code is in the `tablemaker-2.1.1` directory. Precompiled binaries are available on Figshare:
* [OSX Binary](http://figshare.com/articles/Tablemaker_OS_X_Binary/1053136)
* [Linux Binary](http://figshare.com/articles/Tablemaker_Linux_Binary/1053137)

*Note*: Tablemaker relies on Cufflinks version 2.1.1 (released April 2013) to estimate transcript FPKMs, and these estimates may not match FPKM estimates obtained from Cufflinks 2.2.0 (released March 2014) or 2.2.1 (released May 2014). 

Please report any problems as issues on this repository.
